//Q - 1901 Find a peak element II 
/*
A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.
Given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].
You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.

Example 1:
Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]

Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.

Example 2:
Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
Output: [1,1]

Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.

        int mid; 
        while (lo <= hi) {
            mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            int max_row = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (matrix[max_row][mid] < matrix[i][mid])
                    max_row = i;
            }
            if ((mid == 0 || matrix[max_row][mid] > matrix[max_row][mid - 1]) && 
                (mid == m - 1 || matrix[max_row][mid] > matrix[max_row][mid + 1]))
                return {max_row, mid};
            else if (mid > 0 && matrix[max_row][mid - 1] > matrix[max_row][mid])
                hi = mid - 1;
            else
                lo = mid + 1;
        }
        return {-1, -1};
